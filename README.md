Carousel
========

Note, that it is still in development. 
----------
Look at project https://github.com/yudjin87/tour_du_monde for use cases (partially described here http://youtu.be/ajz-kjwT990)

Carousel is a library for building component-oriented desktop applications. It helps extend core functionality of the application by external or internal components. An extension (component) can provide a toolbar with new tools, menus, commands or dock widgets, listen for and respond to events, perform feature validation, or even expose API to JavaScript and so on.
