Carousel
========

Carousel is a managed component library for desktop applications that helps to extending core functionality of the application by external or internal components. An extension (component) can provide a toolbar with new tools or commands, listen for and respond to events, perform feature validation, and so on. External components can be loaded in right order (if they have a dependencies) from the defining paths or can be configured statically in the code (internal components).
