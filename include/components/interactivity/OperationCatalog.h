 * @brief
 *   Use OperationCatalog class to adding and fetching application operations.
 * @details
 *   This class allows you to add new operation that will be used
 *   in Custimozation dialog. Although you can add new operations/actions in the
 *   menus or toolbars directly, it is recomended to register all your operations
 *   in the catalog first - it's allow user to customize interface by adding
 *   your operations to the user defined toolbars.
 *
 *   Use IInteractionService::catalogs().operationCatalog() to get a reference to the operation collection
 *   to add operations specific to your extensions.
