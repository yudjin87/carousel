 * @brief
 *   It is a defaul implementation of the IScriptConsole.
 * @details
 *   There are methods similiar to the just a console or terminal - execute command
 *   and command history. But this object does not pretend for visualizatoin, there
 *   is the ScriptConsoleView for this purpose.
 *
 *   Also, when this interface is implemented, an IOutputHandler one should be implemented
 *   too to be able to redirect print() functions to the console printed() signal.
 *
 *   You can get reference to the IScriptConsole using
 * @code
 *     IScriptingService *service = serviceLocator->locate<IScriptingService>();
 *     IScriptConsole *console = service->console();
 * @endcode
