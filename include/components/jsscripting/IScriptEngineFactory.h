/*!
 * @brief
 *   This interface describes an abstract factory for the QScriptEngine.
 * @details
 *   Because ScriptUnit should create a new QScriptEngine each time it
 *   executes a script (to run it from white board, with clean context),
 *   it is needed some kind of the QScriptEngine factory, because just instantiate
 *   a new instance of the QScriptEngine is not enough - an engine should be
 *   already configured and populated with new functions or types from
 *   other components.
 *
 *   Also, during configuration, an IOutputHandler is set in such way, that all
 *   output, obtained during execution by the QScriptEngine will be redirected
 *   to this handler.
 *
 *   By default, the ScriptingService class implements this interface.
